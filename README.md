#  A* Pathfinding Visualizer (Pygame)

This is a simple graphical Python application that demonstrates the A* pathfinding algorithm using the **Pygame** library. It allows users to interactively create a grid, place barriers, set start and end points, and visualize how the A* algorithm finds the shortest path.

##  Features

- Interactive grid interface
- Left-click to:
  - Place the **start** node (ðŸŸ§ Orange)
  - Place the **end** node (ðŸŸ¦ Turquoise)
  - Place **barriers** (â¬› Black)
- Right-click to:
  - Remove any node or reset a position
- Press `SPACE` to:
  - Start the A* pathfinding algorithm
- Color-coded visualization:
  - **Green (ðŸŸ©)**: Open nodes
  - **Red (ðŸŸ¥)**: Closed nodes
  - **Purple (ðŸŸª)**: Final shortest path
